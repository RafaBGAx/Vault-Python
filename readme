# Python Secure Vault

A script to demonstrate password hashing and verification using SHA-256 and unique salts.

## Technical Approach
This project implements a defense-in-depth strategy for credential storage. Instead of storing passwords in plaintext, the system:
1. Generates a 16-byte random salt using `os.urandom`.
2. Concatenates the salt with the raw password.
3. Produces a SHA-256 hash of the combined string.

By using a unique salt per user, the system remains resilient against rainbow table attacks, ensuring that identical passwords result in different hashes.

## Project Structure
- vault.py: Core logic containing the hashing and verification functions.
- tests.py: Unit tests to validate hash uniqueness and verification logic.
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies (none required for this version).

## Usage
Run the main script to see the hashing in action:
python vault.py

## Running Tests
To verify the security logic:
python tests.py
